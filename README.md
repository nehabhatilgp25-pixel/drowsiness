# Driver Drowsiness Dashboard

This is a dashboard that uses a camera to detect whether a driver's eyes are open or closed and accordingly determines if they are awake or asleep. If they are asleep, a buzzer rings and the online web dashboard displays a screen that informs the user that the driver is asleep.
